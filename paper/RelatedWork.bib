The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the previous one, with respect to both the size of the generated automata and computation time. The testing is performed following a newly developed methodology based on the use of randomly generated formulas.",

Our procedure is based on simulation relations for alternating B{\"u}chi automata. Whereas most of the procedures that have been described in the past compute simulation relations in the last step of the translation (after a nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automaton has already been constructed), our procedure computes simulation relations for alternating B{\"u}chi automata in an early stage and uses them in an on-the- fly fashion. This decreases the time and space consumption without sacrificing the potential of simulation relations.",

The model-checking algorithm that results from this approach is much simpler and cleaner than tableau-based algorithms. We use this approach to extend model checking to probabilistic concurrent finite-state programs.
