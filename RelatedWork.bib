		  manipulation, with command-line utilities, and Python
		  bindings. This paper summarizes its evolution over the past
		  six years, since the release of Spot 2.0, which was the
		  first version to support $\omega$-automata with arbitrary
		  acceptance conditions, and the last version presented at a
		  conference. Since then, Spot has been extended with several
		  features such as acceptance transformations, alternating
		  automata, games, LTL synthesis, and more. We also shed some
		  lights on the data-structure used to store automata. },
