We provide two methods to use and test this project (as described in the [README](./README.md) and [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)):
- Docker Image

    This works on every system with Docker installed (therefore, MacOs, Linux, Windows). It is recommended for trials and artifact evaluation.

- Local Installation

    This method requires a Unix-like system with Python 3.10+ installed. It is recommended for development. We only tested this method on MacOS Ventura and Alpine Linux.
