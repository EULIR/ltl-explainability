---------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Input Files 
You have to provide two files to run the Acacia. One (.ltl) 
contains the ltl formulas to be analyzied and the other (.part) one
specifises the interface. We suggest you to a common filename to those files,
except their extentions, namely, test-1.ltl and test-1.part. 

2) The ouput Files
Acacia will generate various output files w.r.t. different options. Please refer The Options for more details. 

3) The Batch File
Under $YOUR_Acacia_FOLDER/example/, there is a file "demo-call"
which provides a template for running Acacia. There are many options, 
but they are not related to Acacia. You only have to modify the 
"prefix" (line 10), and "demos" (line 11) of "demo-call". Suppose, the 
files are test-1.ltl and test-1.part, you can set 
  prefix="test-"
  demos="`seq 1 1`"
The outputs are available under 
$YOUR_TEST_FOLDER/test-1/
 
4) The Options          
Having set the file "demo-call", you can run Acacia by typing 
 ./demo-call

*) The verbose (-v) option. 
   ./demo-call (or -v 1, default): Acacia will not generate any output files.
   ./demo-call -v 2: Acacia will generate some .dot files for the intermediate 
                     Automata.   
   ./demo-call -v 3: Acacia will generate extra files.
                     antichain.log: It logs the results of EPre and APre. 
										 post.log: Itlogs for foreward fixed-point calculation	
                     tba.dot:  A dot file for "Good for Game Automaton". 
										 bi_0.dot: The reachbility Bigraph of the foreward fixed-point calculation
										 bi_1.dot: The reachbility Bigraph after removing redundant link from bi_0.dot
										 bi_2.dot: The reachbility Bigraph after removing unnecessary node from bi_1.dot						
										 bi_3.dot: The reachbility Bigraph after duplicating some node of bi_2.dot such
															 that all universal fixed-points has only one output.																							 
										 moore.dot: The machine encodes a winning strategy of the controller	
										 mealy.dot: The machine encodes a winning strategy of the environment if the 
																specification is unrealizable.	
   ./demo-call -v 4: Acacia will log each step of the calculation H(f,s) in antichain.log

*) The minimal K (-k) option.
   Setting the minimal value of k to 1. The default value is 0.
   ./demo-call -k 1 
 
*) The maximal K (-K) option.
	 Setting the maximal value of k to 20. The default value is 20
   ./demo-call -K 30:    

*) The winner (-w) option
	 Setting the winner of the game. The winner can be either "mod" (controller) 
	 or "env" (environment). The default value is "mod".
	 For batch file, one can change the option by changing the value of "winner" 	
 	
*) The model checking (-m) option
	 The setting "-m 1" will try model checking with VIS after the synthesis stage. 
	 The default value is "0"
	 To turn on model-checking in batch mode execution, you only have to set "mc=1" in "demo-call".

5) Work without the batch file.
	 For running Acacia without the batch file, please append the folder
		$YOUR_Acacia_FOLDER/lib/
   to the enivronment variable $PATH. And you have to move the 
	 .ltl file and the .part file into your working directory. Then 
   Type the command, like
   $YOUR_Acacia_FOLDER/lib/main.pl -syn YourPart.part -ltl YourLTL.ltl -syndir ./    
 
   For other options, please refer the previous section.   

6) From Dot to PS
	 For different platforms, the dot-to-ps transformation tools are different. 
   To save your effort for manual transformation, you can set your dot-to-ps 
   tool in the subroutine of "dot2ps" in lib/Utils.pm, and remove the heading comment 
   marks before "Utils::dot2ps" in the lib/Acacia.pm. 

7) Model Checking
	 To verify the correctness of the resulting acacia.v, you have to install vis and vl2ml.
